    <em><p>The past and the future intersect with each other in the flow of eternity, the future has already happened in the past and the present has a chaotic order of time. When someone has automatic weapons and tanks, others have magic and swords. And after all, the culture and understanding of the world are different. Not only people, but also monsters. The latter have not changed much, except that they have grown wiser many times. Only the strongest survive. Someone is trying to protect his family, someone for the sake of the wealth of revenge or a sweet pastime, looking at this you think that the person is not a monster, he is worse.</p></em>

    <em><p>My village was attacked when I was still small then I was not even five. That's when I lost my parents, it was a battle between people whom the monsters decided to visit. But easy money never hurts. And after all, the latter were right, they won the upper hand ... That the attacker that the defender were already where time is not subject to the environment. I was saved by our Archmage, who was the main teacher of magic. He dragged me into tunnels that were not known to all citizens. This place was made of pure metal, so much ore I still have not saw. We left a few people 15-20 out of 200 probably. My parents were excellent magicians. Father has fire, mother has water. And with magic I was not so hot the only thing I knew how to do a small cyclone from the air. This of course I have them I was not happy. But I was excellent in archery. My teachers called me Ernest Sharp-eyed.</p><em>
